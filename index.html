                    <p id="subtext">
                        The Times Higher Education Ranking (THE) system ranks universities worldwide based on a few important areas, which are
                       <strong>teaching, research, knowledge transfer and international outlook</strong>. These performance indicators will then be calculated 
                        give an <strong>average overall score</strong>, in which gives us the rankings of the universities worldwide.

            Location is becoming an incresingly important factor when it comes to choosing a university.
            As we can observe from the <strong>EqualEarth Maps</strong> above, we can see that the <strong>United States of America</strong>
            and China tops the first and second place for having the highest total number of students, indicated by the dark colours. </p>

            To further dive deep into the data, we can categorise the countries into continents. It is surprising to note that this time <strong>Asia</strong> tops
            both lists, in which it is the continent with the <strong>most number of universities and student count</strong>.

            This shows the breakdown analysis of top 3 unis in 2021 by THE.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can see that these 3 universities differ most by their industry income scores.

        <p>
            Students are usually most concerned about teaching quality, research output and industry income when it comes to 
            choosing universities.It is interesting to note that there are universities which tops the list even though there 
            are not in the top 10 rankings.
        </p>

            Below is a break down of all the mentioned three determining factors.
