                  <h2>Universities Are Ranked By Overall Scores</h2>
                    <p id="subtext">
                        The Times Higher Education Ranking (THE) system ranks universities worldwide based on a few important areas, which are
                       <strong>teaching, research, knowledge transfer and international outlook</strong>. These performance indicators will then be calculated 
                        give an <strong>average overall score</strong>, in which gives us the rankings of the universities worldwide.

        <h2>Where Are Universities Located And Where Do Most Students Study?</h2>
        <p id="subtext">
            Location is becoming an incresingly important factor when it comes to choosing a university.
            As we can observe from the <strong>EqualEarth Maps</strong> above, we can see that the <strong>United States of America and China</strong>
             tops the first and second place for having the highest total number of students, indicated by the dark colours. </p>

        <h2>What About Continent Specific?</h2>
        <p id="subtext">
            By grouping the countries into their continents, it is interesting to note that <strong>Asia</strong> tops both lists, in which it is actually
            the continent with the most number of universities and students. </p>

              <div class="description description-right">
                <h2>How Does The Top 3 Universities Differ?</h2>
                <p id="subtext">
                    The top 3 universities for the year <i>2021</i> are <strong>University of Oxford, Stanford University, and Harvard University</strong>, with each of them 
                    scoring overall scores of <i>95.6, 94.9, and 94.8</i> out of a maximumscore of 100. While their scores are very similar, if we compare their performance indicators,
                    we will realise that they differ by a lot too. 
                </p>
                <p id="subtext">
                    For example, although all three of the top universities are almost on-par when it comes to teaching, research and citations,
                    but they have very different <strong>international outlook scores</strong>, with Stanford University topping the list, followed by University of Oxford and Harvard University.
                </p>
                <p id="subtext">
                    Thus, when deciding between universities, students should always compare their breakdown marks in detail to find the best fit for their needs, and not just purely depend on the 
                    ranking of the university only.

        <h2>Performance Indicators: What Potential Students Want To Know</h2>
        <p id="subtext">
            There's a lot of things to consider when it comes to selecting "THE" perfect university which a student would call it <i>"home"</i> for the next 3 to 4 years.
            Out of all performance indicators, the three indicators below are usually the ones which students are most concerned about, namely: <i>teaching, research, and citations score</i>.</p>
        <p id="subtext">
            <strong>Teaching Score: </strong>This score shows how good the quality of teaching is at a certain university.
        </p>
        <p id="subtext">
            <strong>Research Score: </strong>This score is important because it indicates the level of opportunities provided for students to take up research projects at a university.
        </p>
        <p id="subtext">
            <strong>Industry Income Score: </strong>This score shows how well a university is at attracting fundings for their research activities.
        </p>

            </div>
            <div class="pure-u-1-3">
              <div class="description description-right">
                <h2>Teaching Scores</h2>
                <p id="subtext">
                   Teaching Scores are very heavily weighted when it comes to the Times Higher Education (THE) rankings, in which it has a <i>30%</i> weightage just for this performance indicator.
                   It is assessed over a series of criterias, such as <i>reputation survery, PhD Academic Staff, Student-to-Staff Ratio, Institutional Income and PhD awards</i>. In this list,
                   we can see that the top 10 universities ranked by teaching scores are also found in the overall top 10 rank, due to its significant weightage by THE rankings.  
                </p>
                <h2>Research Scores</h2>
                <p id="subtext">
                   Research Scores are assessed over a three sets of criterias, such as <i>reputation survery, Research Income and Scholarly Papers</i>. In this list,
                   unsurprisingly, we can also see that the top 10 universities ranked by research scores are also found in the overall top 10 rank, due to its significant weightage of <i>30%</i> by THE rankings.  
                </p>
                <h2>Industry Income Scores</h2>
                <p id="subtext">
                   Industry Income Scores are assessed based on innovation, which carries a percentage of <i>2.5%</i> only. Thus, it is interesting to note that most universities that tops this list do not always appear
                   in the top rankings, as the weightage of it is rather small compared to other performance indicators.
