                  <h2>Universities Are Ranked By Overall Scores</h2>
                    <p id="subtext">
                        The Times Higher Education Ranking (THE) system ranks universities worldwide based on a few important areas, which are
                       <strong>teaching, research, knowledge transfer and international outlook</strong>. These performance indicators will then be calculated 
                        give an <strong>average overall score</strong>, in which gives us the rankings of the universities worldwide.

        <h2>Where Are Universities Located And Where Do Most Students Study?</h2>
        <p id="subtext">
            Location is becoming an incresingly important factor when it comes to choosing a university.
            As we can observe from the <strong>EqualEarth Maps</strong> above, we can see that the <strong>United States of America and China</strong>
             tops the first and second place for having the highest total number of students, indicated by the dark colours. </p>

        <h2>What About Continent Specific?</h2>
        <p id="subtext" class="vis-container">
            By grouping the countries into their continents, it is interesting to note that <strong>Asia</strong> tops both lists, in which it is actually
            the continent with the most number of universities and students. </p>
